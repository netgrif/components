The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @covalent/highlight@3.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## TdHighlightComponent: td-highlight

`td-highlight` is an @angular component that uses native **@angular** to parse code to HTML elements. It is based on [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) library.

This implementation supports all the Common languages in *highlight.js*.

**Note:** This module uses the **DomSanitizer** service to ~sanitize~ the parsed `html` from the `highlight.js` lib to avoid **XSS** issues.

By default, `--dev` build will log the following message in the console to let you know:

`WARNING: sanitizing HTML stripped some content (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss).`

## API Summary

#### Inputs

+ lang: string
  + Language of the code content to be parsed as highlighted html.
   > **DEPRECATION WARNING: lang attribute is deprecated and it will be removed in v4.0.0**
+ codeLang: string
  + Language of the code content to be parsed as highlighted html.
+ content: string
  + Code content to be parsed as highlighted html. Used to load data dynamically. e.g. `.ts` content.
+ copyCodeToClipboard?: boolean
  + Display copy button on code snippets to copy code to clipboard.
+ copyCodeTooltips?: ICopyCodeTooltips
  + Tooltips for copy button to copy and upon copying.

For reference:
```
interface ICopyCodeTooltips {
  copy?: string;
  copied?: string;
}
```
#### Events

+ contentReady: function
  + Event emitted after the highlight content rendering is finished.

## Installation

This component can be installed as npm package.

```bash
npm i -save @covalent/highlight
```

## Setup

Import the **[CovalentHighlightModule]** in your NgModule:

```typescript
import { CovalentHighlightModule } from '@covalent/highlight';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CovalentHighlightModule,
    ...
  ],
  ...
})
export class MyModule {}
```

### Theming

The `highlight` module comes with its own default `covalent` theme which you can use by importing our theme scss file.

```css
@import '~@covalent/highlight/highlight-theme';

@include covalent-highlight-theme();
```

Alternatively, you can use the *highlight.js* pre-built [themes](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles) by loading them either by an import:

```css
@import '~highlight.js/styles/vs.css';
```

Loading them in the `.angular-cli.json`:

```json
"styles": [
  "/path/to/node_modules/highlight.js/styles/vs.css"
]
```

Or by loading them in the `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/node_modules/highlight.js/styles/vs.css">
```

## Usage

Simply create a template literal string with your code and bind your snippets in `<td-highlight>{{code}}</td-highlight>`.

Example for **HTML** usage:
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <td-highlight codeLang="html">
      {{ code }}
    </td-highlight>
  `,
})
class ExampleComponent {
  code: string = `
    <td-highlight codeLang="html">
      <h1>hello world!</h1>
      <span>{ {property} }</span>
    </td-highlight>
  `;
}
```
Example for **CSS** usage:
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <td-highlight codeLang="css">
      {{ code }}
    </td-highlight>
  `,
})
class ExampleComponent {
  code: string = `
    pre {
      display: block;
      overflow-x: auto;
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
      background: #002451;
      color: white;
      font-family: Menlo, Monaco, "Andale Mono", "lucida console", "Courier New", monospace;
      line-height: 1.45;
      tab-size: 2;
      -webkit-font-smoothing: auto;
      -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
      position: relative;
      border-radius: 2px;
    }
  `;
}
```
Example for **Typescript**:
```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <td-highlight codeLang="typescript">
      {{ code }}
    </td-highlight>
  `,
})
class ExampleComponent {
  code: string = `
    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
    import { Observable, Subject } from 'rxjs';

    @Injectable()
    export class Service {

      private _sources: {[key : string]: Subject<any>} = {};
      private _observables: {[key: string]: Observable<any>} = {};

      constructor() {

      }

      public register(name) : Observable<any> {
        this._sources[name] = new Subject<any>();
        this._observables[name] = this._sources[name].asObservable();
        return this._observables[name];
      }

      public emit(name: string): void {
        if(this._sources[name]) {
          this._sources[name].next(null);
        }
      }
    }
  `;

**If you use SystemJS** to load your files, you can check the [plunkr example](https://plnkr.co/edit/XXwyUYS6ZL7qVD9I2l0g?p=preview) for a working setup that uses the cdn [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/).
If you're importing directly from `node_modules`, you should edit your systemjs config file and add `'@ngx-translate/core': 'node_modules/@ngx-translate/core/bundles'` in the map and `'@ngx-translate/core' : { defaultExtension: 'js' }` in packages.


## Usage

#### 1. Import the `TranslateModule`:

Finally, you can use ngx-translate in your Angular project. You have to import `TranslateModule.forRoot()` in the root NgModule of your application.

The [`forRoot`](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterModule#forroot) static method is a convention that provides and configures services at the same time.
Make sure you only call this method in the root module of your application, most of the time called `AppModule`.
This method allows you to configure the `TranslateModule` by specifying a loader, a parser and/or a missing translations handler.

```ts
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {TranslateModule} from '@ngx-translate/core';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot()
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

##### SharedModule

If you use a [`SharedModule`](https://angular.io/guide/sharing-ngmodules) that you import in multiple other feature modules,
you can export the `TranslateModule` to make sure you don't have to import it in every module.

```ts
@NgModule({
    exports: [
        CommonModule,
        TranslateModule
    ]
})
export class SharedModule { }
```

> Note: Never call a `forRoot` static method in the `SharedModule`. You might end up with different instances of the service in your injector tree. But you can use `forChild` if necessary.

##### Lazy loaded modules

When you lazy load a module, you should use the `forChild` static method to import the `TranslateModule`.

Since lazy loaded modules use a different injector from the rest of your application, you can configure them separately with a different loader/compiler/parser/missing translations handler.

To make a child module extend translations from parent modules use `extend: true`. This will cause the service to also
use translations from its parent module.

You can also isolate the service by using `isolate: true`. In which case the service is a completely isolated instance (for translations, current lang, events, ...).
Otherwise, by default, it will share its data with other instances of the service (but you can still use a different loader/compiler/parser/handler even if you don't isolate the service).

```ts
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        TranslateModule.forChild({
            loader: {provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: CustomLoader},
            compiler: {provide: TranslateCompiler, useClass: CustomCompiler},
            parser: {provide: TranslateParser, useClass: CustomParser},
            missingTranslationHandler: {provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: CustomHandler},
            isolate: true
        })
    ]
})
export class LazyLoadedModule { }
```

##### Configuration

By default, there is no loader available. You can add translations manually using `setTranslation` but it is better to use a loader.
You can write your own loader, or import an existing one.
For example you can use the [`TranslateHttpLoader`](https://github.com/ngx-translate/http-loader) that will load translations from files using HttpClient.

To use it, you need to install the http-loader package from @ngx-translate:

```sh
npm install @ngx-translate/http-loader --save
```

**NB: if you're still on Angular <4.3, please use Http from @angular/http with http-loader@0.1.0.**

Once you've decided which loader to use, you have to setup the `TranslateModule` to use it.

Here is how you would use the `TranslateHttpLoader` to load translations from "/assets/i18n/[lang].json" (`[lang]` is the lang that you're using, for english it could be `en`):

```ts
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {HttpClientModule, HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';
import {TranslateModule, TranslateLoader} from '@ngx-translate/core';
import {TranslateHttpLoader} from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';
import {AppComponent} from './app';

// AoT requires an exported function for factories
export function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {
    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);
}

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        HttpClientModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            loader: {
                provide: TranslateLoader,
                useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,
                deps: [HttpClient]
            }
        })
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

##### AoT

If you want to configure a custom `TranslateLoader` while using [AoT compilation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) or [Ionic](http://ionic.io/), you must use an exported function instead of an inline function.

```ts
export function createTranslateLoader(http: HttpClient) {
    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http, './assets/i18n/', '.json');
}

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        HttpClientModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            loader: {
                provide: TranslateLoader,
                useFactory: (createTranslateLoader),
                deps: [HttpClient]
            }
        })
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

#### 2. Define the `default language` for the application

```ts
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            defaultLanguage: 'en'
        })
    ],
    providers: [

    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

#### 3. Init the `TranslateService` for your application:

```ts
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {TranslateService} from '@ngx-translate/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app',
    template: `
        <div>{{ 'HELLO' | translate:param }}</div>
    `
})
export class AppComponent {
    param = {value: 'world'};

    constructor(translate: TranslateService) {
        // this language will be used as a fallback when a translation isn't found in the current language
        translate.setDefaultLang('en');

         // the lang to use, if the lang isn't available, it will use the current loader to get them
        translate.use('en');
    }
}
```

#### 4. Define the translations:

Once you've imported the `TranslateModule`, you can put your translations in a json file that will be imported with the `TranslateHttpLoader`. The following translations should be stored in `en.json`.

```json
{
    "HELLO": "hello {{value}}"
}
```

You can also define your translations manually with `setTranslation`.

```ts
translate.setTranslation('en', {
    HELLO: 'hello {{value}}'
});
```

The `TranslateParser` understands nested JSON objects. This means that you can have a translation that looks like this:

```json
{
    "HOME": {
        "HELLO": "hello {{value}}"
    }
}
```

You can then access the value by using the dot notation, in this case `HOME.HELLO`.

#### 5. Use the service, the pipe or the directive:

You can either use the `TranslateService`, the `TranslatePipe` or the `TranslateDirective` to get your translation values.

With the **service**, it looks like this:

```ts
translate.get('HELLO', {value: 'world'}).subscribe((res: string) => {
    console.log(res);
    //=> 'hello world'
});
```

This is how you do it with the **pipe**:

```html
<div>{{ 'HELLO' | translate:param }}</div>
```

And in your component define `param` like this:
```ts
param = {value: 'world'};
```

You can construct the translation keys dynamically by using simple string concatenation inside the template:

```html
<ul *ngFor="let language of languages">
  <li>{{ 'LANGUAGES.' + language | translate }}</li>
</ul>
```

Where `languages` is an array member of your component:

```ts
languages = ['EN', 'FR', 'BG'];
```

You can also use the output of the built-in pipes `uppercase` and `lowercase` in order to guarantee that your dynamically generated translation keys are either all uppercase or all lowercase. For example:

```html
<p>{{ 'ROLES.' + role | uppercase | translate }}</p>
```

```ts
role = 'admin';
```

will match the following translation:
```json
{
  "ROLES": {
    "ADMIN": "Administrator"
  }
}
```

This is how you use the **directive**:
```html
<div [translate]="'HELLO'" [translateParams]="{value: 'world'}"></div>
```

Or even simpler using the content of your element as a key:
```html
<div translate [translateParams]="{value: 'world'}">HELLO</div>
```

#### 6. Use HTML tags:

You can easily use raw HTML tags within your translations.

```json
{
    "HELLO": "Welcome to my Angular application!<br><strong>This is an amazing app which uses the latest technologies!</strong>"
}
```

To render them, simply use the `innerHTML` attribute with the pipe on any element.

```html
<div [innerHTML]="'HELLO' | translate"></div>
```

## API

### TranslateService

#### Properties:

- `currentLang`: The lang currently used
- `currentLoader`: An instance of the loader currently used (static loader by default)
- `onLangChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to lang change events. A `LangChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).

    example:
    ```ts
    onLangChange.subscribe((event: LangChangeEvent) => {
	  // do something
	});
    ```
- `onTranslationChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to translation change events. A `TranslationChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).

    example:
    ```ts
    onTranslationChange.subscribe((event: TranslationChangeEvent) => {
	  // do something
	});
    ```
- `onDefaultLangChange`: An EventEmitter to listen to default lang change events. A `DefaultLangChangeEvent` is an object with the properties `lang: string` & `translations: any` (an object containing your translations).

    example:
    ```ts
    onDefaultLangChange.subscribe((event: DefaultLangChangeEvent) => {
	  // do something
	});
    ```

#### Methods:

- `setDefaultLang(lang: string)`: Sets the default language to use as a fallback
- `getDefaultLang(): string`: Gets the default language
- `use(lang: string): Observable<any>`: Changes the lang currently used
- `getTranslation(lang: string): Observable<any>`: Gets an object of translations for a given language with the current loader
- `setTranslation(lang: string, translations: Object, shouldMerge: boolean = false)`: Manually sets an object of translations for a given language, set `shouldMerge` to true if you want to append the translations instead of replacing them
- `addLangs(langs: Array<string>)`: Add new langs to the list
- `getLangs()`: Returns an array of currently available langs
- `get(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Gets the translated value of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found
- `getStreamOnTranslationChange(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Returns a stream of translated values of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found. Without any `onTranslationChange` events this returns the same value as `get` but it will also emit new values whenever the translation changes.
- `stream(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): Observable<string|Object>`: Returns a stream of translated values of a key (or an array of keys) or the key if the value was not found. Without any `onLangChange` events this returns the same value as `get` but it will also emit new values whenever the used language changes.
- `instant(key: string|Array<string>, interpolateParams?: Object): string|Object`: Gets the instant translated value of a key (or an array of keys). /!\ This method is **synchronous** and the default file loader is asynchronous. You are responsible for knowing when your translations have been loaded and it is safe to use this method. If you are not sure then you should use the `get` method instead.
- `set(key: string, value: string, lang?: string)`: Sets the translated value of a key
- `reloadLang(lang: string): Observable<string|Object>`: Calls resetLang and retrieves the translations object for the current loader
- `resetLang(lang: string)`: Removes the current translations for this lang. /!\ You will have to call `use`, `reloadLang` or `getTranslation` again to be able to get translations
- `getBrowserLang(): string | undefined`: Returns the current browser lang if available, or undefined otherwise
- `getBrowserCultureLang(): string | undefined`: Returns the current browser culture language name (e.g. "de-DE" if available, or undefined otherwise

#### Write & use your own loader

If you want to write your own loader, you need to create a class that implements `TranslateLoader`. The only required method is `getTranslation` that must return an `Observable`. If your loader is synchronous, just use [`Observable.of`](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/of.md) to create an observable from your static value.

##### Example

```ts
class CustomLoader implements TranslateLoader {
    getTranslation(lang: string): Observable<any> {
        return Observable.of({KEY: 'value'});
    }
}
```

Once you've defined your loader, you can provide it in your configuration by adding it to its `providers` property.

```ts
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            loader: {provide: TranslateLoader, useClass: CustomLoader}
        })
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
[Another custom loader example with translations stored in Firebase](FIREBASE_EXAMPLE.md)

#### How to use a compiler to preprocess translation values

By default, translation values are added "as-is". You can configure a `compiler` that implements `TranslateCompiler` to pre-process translation values when they are added (either manually or by a loader). A compiler has the following methods:

- `compile(value: string, lang: string): string | Function`: Compiles a string to a function or another string.
- `compileTranslations(translations: any, lang: string): any`:  Compiles a (possibly nested) object of translation values to a structurally identical object of compiled translation values.

Using a compiler opens the door for powerful pre-processing of translation values. As long as the compiler outputs a compatible interpolation string or an interpolation function, arbitrary input syntax can be supported.


#### How to handle missing translations

You can setup a provider for the `MissingTranslationHandler` in the bootstrap of your application (recommended), or in the `providers` property of a component. It will be called when the requested translation is not available. The only required method is `handle` where you can do whatever you want. If this method returns a value or an observable (that should return a string), then this will be used. Just don't forget that it will be called synchronously from the `instant` method.

You can use `useDefaultLang` to decide whether default language string should be used when there is a missing translation in current language. Default value is true. If you set it to false, `MissingTranslationHandler` will be used instead of the default language string.

##### Example:

Create a Missing Translation Handler

```ts
import {MissingTranslationHandler, MissingTranslationHandlerParams} from '@ngx-translate/core';

export class MyMissingTranslationHandler implements MissingTranslationHandler {
    handle(params: MissingTranslationHandlerParams) {
        return 'some value';
    }
}
```

Setup the Missing Translation Handler in your module import by adding it to the `forRoot` (or `forChild`) configuration.

```ts
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            missingTranslationHandler: {provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: MyMissingTranslationHandler},
            useDefaultLang: false
        })
    ],
    providers: [

    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### Parser

If you need it for some reason, you can use the `TranslateParser` service.

#### Methods:
- `interpolate(expr: string | Function, params?: any): string`: Interpolates a string to replace parameters or calls the interpolation function with the parameters.

    `This is a {{ key }}` ==> `This is a value` with `params = { key: "value" }`
    `(params) => \`This is a ${params.key}\` ==> `This is a value` with `params = { key: "value" }`
- `getValue(target: any, key: string): any`:  Gets a value from an object by composed key
     `parser.getValue({ key1: { keyA: 'valueI' }}, 'key1.keyA') ==> 'valueI'`

## FAQ

#### I'm getting an error `npm ERR! peerinvalid Peer [...]`

If you're using npm 2.x, upgrade to npm 3.x, because npm 2 doesn't handle peer dependencies well. With npm 2 you could only use fixed versions, but with npm 3 you can use `^` to use a newer version if available.

If you're already on npm 3, check if it's an error (`npm ERR!`) or a warning (`npm WARN!`), warning are just informative and if everything works then don't worry !

If you're using an old version of Angular and ngx-translate requires a newer version then you should consider upgrading your application to use the newer angular 2 version. There is always a reason when I upgrade the minimum dependencies of the library. Often it is because Angular had a breaking changes. If it's not an option for you, then check [the changelog](/releases) to know which version is the last compatible version for you.

#### I want to hot reload the translations in my application but `reloadLang` does not work

If you want to reload the translations and see the update on all your components without reloading the page, you have to load the translations manually and call `setTranslation` function which triggers `onTranslationChange`.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)

## Installation

We assume that you already installed [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core).

Now you need to install the npm module for `TranslateHttpLoader`:

```sh
npm install @ngx-translate/http-loader --save
```

Choose the version corresponding to your Angular version:

 Angular     | @ngx-translate/core | @ngx-translate/http-loader
 ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------
 10          | 13.x+               | 6.x+
 9           | 12.x+               | 5.x+
 8           | 12.x+               | 4.x+
 7           | 11.x+               | 4.x+
 6           | 10.x                | 3.x
 5           | 8.x to 9.x          | 1.x to 2.x
 4.3         | 7.x or less         | 1.x to 2.x
 2 to 4.2.x  | 7.x or less         | 0.x

## Usage
#### 1. Setup the `TranslateModule` to use the `TranslateHttpLoader`:

The `TranslateHttpLoader` uses HttpClient to load translations, which means that you have to import the HttpClientModule from `@angular/common/http` before the `TranslateModule`:

```ts
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {HttpClientModule, HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';
import {TranslateModule, TranslateLoader} from '@ngx-translate/core';
import {TranslateHttpLoader} from '@ngx-translate/http-loader';
import {AppComponent} from "./app";

// AoT requires an exported function for factories
export function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {
    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http);
}

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        HttpClientModule,
        TranslateModule.forRoot({
            loader: {
                provide: TranslateLoader,
                useFactory: HttpLoaderFactory,
                deps: [HttpClient]
            }
        })
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The `TranslateHttpLoader` also has two optional parameters:
- prefix: string = "/assets/i18n/"
- suffix: string = ".json"

By using those default parameters, it will load your translations files for the lang "en" from: `/assets/i18n/en.json`.

You can change those in the `HttpLoaderFactory` method that we just defined. For example if you want to load the "en" translations from `/public/lang-files/en-lang.json` you would use:

```ts
export function HttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient) {
    return new TranslateHttpLoader(http, "/public/lang-files/", "-lang.json");
}
```

For now this loader only support the json format.

## Angular CLI/Webpack TranslateLoader Example
If you are using Angular CLI (uses webpack under the hood) you can write your own `TranslateLoader` that always loads the latest translation file available during your application build.

```typescript
// webpack-translate-loader.ts
import { TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';

export class WebpackTranslateLoader implements TranslateLoader {
  getTranslation(lang: string): Observable<any> {
    return Observable.fromPromise(System.import(`../assets/i18n/${lang}.json`));
  }
}
```

Cause `System` will not be available you need to add it to your custom `typings.d.ts`:
```typescript
declare var System: System;
interface System {
  import(request: string): Promise<any>;
}
```

Now you can use the `WebpackTranslateLoader` with your `app.module`:
```typescript
@NgModule({
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    TranslateModule.forRoot({
      loader: {
        provide: TranslateLoader,
        useClass: WebpackTranslateLoader
      }
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The disadvantage of this solution is that you have to rebuild the application everytime your translate files has changes.

Angular directive for detecting changes of an element size.

It is as simple as:

```html
<div (resized)="onResized($event)"></div>
```

It internally uses `ResizeSensor` from [CSS Element Queries](https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries).

## Playground

[StackBlitz playground](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-resize-event-playground?file=src/app/app.component.html)

## Using the library

Import the library in any Angular application by running:

```bash
$ npm install angular-resize-event
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import the library module
import { AngularResizeEventModule } from 'angular-resize-event';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify AngularResizeEventModule library as an import
    AngularResizeEventModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its `resized` directive in your Angular application:

```html
<div (resized)="onResized($event)"></div>
```

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

// Import the resized event model
import { ResizedEvent } from 'angular-resize-event';

@Component({...})
class MyComponent {
  width: number;
  height: number;

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Fast Diff [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jhchen/fast-diff)

This is a simplified import of the excellent [diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) library by [Neil Fraser](https://neil.fraser.name/) into the Node.js environment. The match and patch parts are removed, as well as all the extra diff options. What remains is incredibly fast diffing between two strings.

 The diff function is an implementation of ["An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf) with the suggested divide and conquer strategy along with several [optimizations](http://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/10/09/) Neil added.

```js
var diff = require('fast-diff');

var good = 'Good dog';
var bad = 'Bad dog';

var result = diff(good, bad);
// [[-1, "Goo"], [1, "Ba"], [0, "d dog"]]

// Respect suggested edit location (cursor position), added in v1.1
diff('aaa', 'aaaa', 1)
// [[0, "a"], [1, "a"], [0, "aa"]]

// For convenience
diff.INSERT === 1;
diff.EQUAL === 0;
diff.DELETE === -1;
```

> Compile json schema to typescript typings

## Example

Input:
```json
{
  "title": "Example Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {

export interface ExampleSchema {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  /**
   * Age in years
   */
  age?: number;
  hairColor?: "black" | "brown" | "blue";
}
```

## Installation

# Using Yarn:
yarn add json-schema-to-typescript

# Or, using NPM:
npm install json-schema-to-typescript --save
```

## Usage

```js
import { compile, compileFromFile } from 'json-schema-to-typescript'

// compile from file
compileFromFile('foo.json')
  .then(ts => fs.writeFileSync('foo.d.ts', ts))

// or, compile a JS object
let mySchema = {
  properties: [...]
}
compile(mySchema, 'MySchema')
  .then(ts => ...)
```

See [server demo](example) and [browser demo](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript-browser) for full examples.

## Options

`compileFromFile` and `compile` accept options as their last argument (all keys are optional):

| key | type | default | description |
|-|-|-|-|
| bannerComment | string | `"/* tslint:disable */\n/**\n* This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.\n* DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,\n* and run json-schema-to-typescript to regenerate this file.\n*/"` | Disclaimer comment prepended to the top of each generated file |
| cwd | string | `process.cwd()` | Root directory for resolving [`$ref`](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03.html)s |
| declareExternallyReferenced | boolean | `true` | Declare external schemas referenced via `$ref`? |
| enableConstEnums | boolean | `true` | Prepend enums with [`const`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#computed-and-constant-members)? |
| ignoreMinAndMaxItems | boolean | `false` | Ignore maxItems and minItems for `array` types, preventing tuples being generated. |
| style | object | `{ bracketSpacing: false,  printWidth: 120,  semi: true,  singleQuote: false,  tabWidth: 2,  trailingComma: 'none',  useTabs: false }` | A [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) configuration |
| unreachableDefinitions | boolean | `false` | Generates code for `definitions` that aren't referenced by the schema. |
| strictIndexSignatures | boolean | `false` | Append all index signatures with `| undefined` so that they are strictly typed. |
| $refOptions | object | `{}` | [$RefParser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/json-schema-ref-parser) Options, used when resolving `$ref`s |
## CLI

A simple CLI utility is provided with this package.

```sh
cat foo.json | json2ts > foo.d.ts
# or
json2ts foo.json > foo.d.ts
# or
json2ts foo.json foo.d.ts
# or
json2ts --input foo.json --output foo.d.ts
# or
json2ts -i foo.json -o foo.d.ts
```

You can pass any of the options described above (including style options) as CLI flags. Boolean values can be set to false using the `no-` prefix.

```sh
# generate code for definitions that aren't referenced
json2ts -i foo.json -o foo.d.ts --unreachableDefinitions
# use single quotes and disable trailing semicolons
json2ts -i foo.json -o foo.d.ts --style.singleQuote --no-style.semi
```

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

## Installation

- `npm install ngx-quill`
- for projects using Angular < v5.0.0 install `npm install ngx-quill@1.6.0`
- install `@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/forms`, `@angular/platform-browser`, `quill`, and `rxjs` - peer dependencies of ngx-quill
- include theme stylings: bubble.css, snow.css of quilljs in your index.html, or add them in your css/scss files with `@import` statements, or add them external stylings in your build process.

### For standard webpack, angular-cli and tsc builds

- import `QuillModule` from `ngx-quill`:
```TS
import { QuillModule } from 'ngx-quill'
```
- add `QuillModule` to the imports of your NgModule:
```TS
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,

    QuillModule.forRoot()
  ],
  ...
})
class YourModule { ... }
```
- use `<quill-editor></quill-editor>` in your templates to add a default quill editor
- do not forget to include quill + theme css in your buildprocess, module or index.html!
- for builds with angular-cli >=6 only add quilljs to your scripts or scripts section of angular.json, if you need it as a global :)!

**HINT:** *If you are using lazy loading modules, you have to add `QuillModule.forRoot()` to your imports in your root module to make sure the `Config` services is registered.*

## Angular Universal

### ngx-quill >= v10

Nothing to do here :)

### ngx-quill v9

QuillJS (1.x) is directly using the `document`, `window`, `Node` and `navigator` context of the browser, when you require or import it.
To get things working in ssr you need to mock them on server side.

Change your `main.server.ts` to something like

```TS
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

// Mock all used objects and functions used by Quill
global['window'] = {}
global['document'] = {
  createElement: () => ({
    classList: {
      toggle: () => {},
      contains: () => {}
    }
  }),
  addEventListener: () => {}
}
global['Node'] = {}
global['navigator'] = {}

export { AppServerModule } from './app/app.server.module';
export { renderModule, renderModuleFactory } from '@angular/platform-server';
```

The `quill-editor` and `quill-view` component of ngx-quill are doing the rest for you to check, if it is running on server- or browser side.
On server-side both components will not render or do anything, because they depend on QuillJS and so on the real browser environment.

**Hint:** Set `suppressGlobalRegisterWarning: true` in the global config to suppress quilljs warnings.

If you want to render your html content of the editor for seo purposes check out the `quill-view-html` component, that simply renders the html content :).

## Global Config

It is possible to set custom default modules and Quill config options with the import of the `QuillModule.forRoot()`.

```TS
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,

    QuillModule.forRoot({
      modules: {
        syntax: true,
        toolbar: [...]
      }
    })
  ],
  ...
})
class YourModule { ... }

```

If you want to use the `syntax` module follow the [Syntax Highlight Module Guide](https://quilljs.com/docs/modules/syntax/#syntax-highlighter-module).

See [Quill Configuration](https://quilljs.com/docs/configuration/) for a full list of config options.

The `QuillModule` exports the `defaultModules` if you want to extend them :).

### Custom Modules and options/formats

- use customOptions for adding for example custom font sizes or other options/formats
- use customModules for adding and overwriting modules, e.g. image-resize or your own modules

### Suppress global register warnings

Per default when `Quill.register` is called and you are overwriting an already existing module, QuillJS logs a warning. If you pass `customOptions` or `customModules` ngx-quill is registering those modules/options/formats for you.

In e.g. an angular univeral project your `AppModule` and so `QuillModule.forRoot()` is executed twice (1x server side, 1x browser). QuillJS is running in a mocked env on server side, so it is intendet that every register runs twice.

To subpress those expected warnings you can turn them off by passing `suppressGlobalRegisterWarning: true`.

## QuillEditorComponent

### Hint

Ngx-quill updates the ngModel or formControl for every `user` change in the editor.
Checkout the [QuillJS Source](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#events) parameter of the `text-change` event.

If you are using the editor reference to directly manipulate the editor content and want to update the model, pass `'user'` as the source parameter to the QuillJS api methods.

### Config

- ngModel - set initial value or allow two-way databinding for template driven forms
- formControl/formControlName - set initial value or allow two-way databinding for reactive forms
- readOnly (true | false) if user can edit content
- formats - array of allowed formats/groupings
- format - model format - default: `html`, values: `html | object | text | json`, sets the model value type - html = html string, object = quill operation object, json = quill operation json, text = plain text
- modules - configure/disable quill modules, e.g toolbar or add custom toolbar via html element default is
```TS
const modules = {
  toolbar: [
    ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strike'],        // toggled buttons
    ['blockquote', 'code-block'],

    [{ 'header': 1 }, { 'header': 2 }],               // custom button values
    [{ 'list': 'ordered'}, { 'list': 'bullet' }],
    [{ 'script': 'sub'}, { 'script': 'super' }],      // superscript/subscript
    [{ 'indent': '-1'}, { 'indent': '+1' }],          // outdent/indent
    [{ 'direction': 'rtl' }],                         // text direction

    [{ 'size': ['small', false, 'large', 'huge'] }],  // custom dropdown
    [{ 'header': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, false] }],

    [{ 'color': [] }, { 'background': [] }],          // dropdown with defaults from theme
    [{ 'font': [] }],
    [{ 'align': [] }],

    ['clean'],                                         // remove formatting button

    ['link', 'image', 'video']                         // link and image, video
  ]
};
```
- theme - bubble/snow, default is `snow`
- sanitize - uses angulars DomSanitizer to santize html values - default: `false`, boolean (only for format="html")
- styles - set a styles object, e.g. `[styles]="{height: '250px'}"`
- placeholder - placeholder text, default is `Insert text here ...`
- bounds - boundary of the editor, default `document.body`, pass 'self' to attach the editor element
- maxLength - add validation for maxlength - set model state to `invalid` and add `ng-invalid` class

## QuillViewComponent, QuillViewHTMLComponent & How to present the editor content

In most cases a wysiwyg editor is used in backoffice to store the content to the database. On the other side this value should be used, to show the content to the enduser.

In most cases the `html` format is used, but it is not recommended by QuillJS, because it has the intention to be a solid, easy to maintain editor. Because of that it uses blots and object representations of the content and operation.

This content object is easy to store and to maintain, because there is no html syntax parsing necessary. So you even switching to another editor is very easy when you can work with that.

`ngx-quill` provides some helper components, to present quilljs content.

### QuillViewComponent - Using QuillJS to render content

In general QuillJS recommends to use a QuillJS instance to present your content.
Just create a quill editor without a toolbar and in readonly mode. With some simple css lines you can remove the default border around the content.

As a helper `ngx-quill` provides a component where you can pass many options of the `quill-editor` like modules, format, formats, customOptions, but renders only the content as readonly and without a toolbar. Import is the `content` input, where you can pass the editor content you want to present.

#### Config

- content - the content to be presented
- formats - array of allowed formats/groupings
- format - model format - default: `html`, values: `html | object | text | json`, sets the model value type - html = html string, object = quill operation object, json = quill operation json, text = plain text
- modules - configure/disable quill modules
- theme - bubble/snow, default is `snow`
- debug - set log level `warn`, `error`, `log` or `false` to deactivate logging, default: `warn`
- use customOptions for adding for example custom font sizes --> this overwrites this options **globally** !!!
- use customModules for adding and overwriting modules --> this overwrites this modules **globally** !!!
- strict - default: true, sets editor in strict mode
- preserveWhitespace - default: false - possbility to use a pre-tag instead of a div-tag for the contenteditable area to preserve duplicated whitespaces | caution if used with syntax plugin [Related issue](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/1751)
- sanitize - uses angulars DomSanitizer to santize html values - default: `false`, boolean (only for format="html")

```HTML
<quill-view [content]="content" format="text" theme="snow"></quill-view>
```

### QuillViewHTMLComponent - Using angular [innerHTML]

Most of you will use the `html` format (even it is not recommended). To render custom html with angular you should use the `[innerHTML]` attribute.

But there are some pitfalls:

1. You need to have the quill css files loaded, when using classes and not inline styling (https://quilljs.com/guides/how-to-customize-quill/#class-vs-inline)
2. When using classes use a `div`-tag that has the `innerHTML` attribute and add the `ql-editor` class. Wrap your div in another `div`-tag with css classes `ql-container` and your theme, e.g. `ql-snow`.:

```HTML
<div class="ql-container ql-snow" style="border-width: 0;">
  <div class="ql-editor" [innerHTML]="byPassedHTMLString">
  </div>
</div>
```

3. Angular has html sanitation, so it will strip unkown or not trusted parts of your HTML - just mark your html as trusted ([DomSanitizer](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/DomSanitizer))

After that your content should look like what you expected.

If you store html in your database, checkout your backend code, sometimes backends are stripping unwanted tags as well ;).

As a helper `ngx-quill` provides a component where you can simply pass your html string and the component does everything for you to render it:

- add necessary css classes
- bypass html sanitation

```HTML
<quill-view-html [content]="htmlstring" theme="snow"></quill-view-html>
```

#### Config

As inputs you can set the `content` and optional the `theme` (default is `snow`).

- content - html string to be presented
- theme - bubble/snow, default is `snow`

## Security Hint

Angular templates provide some assurance against XSS in the form of client side sanitizing of all inputs https://angular.io/guide/security#xss.

Ngx-quill components provide the input paramter `sanitize` to sanitize html-strings passed as `ngModel` or `formControl` to the component.

It is **deactivated per default** to avoid stripping content or styling, which is not expected.

But it is **recommended** to activate this option, if you are working with html strings as model values.

    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
